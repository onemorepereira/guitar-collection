    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 2025</p>

    <div class="friendly-note">
        <strong>🔒 Privacy in Plain English</strong><br>
        We believe privacy should be simple and transparent. This policy explains what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do (and don't do) with it. No hidden surprises, no fine print tricks.
    </div>

    <h2>1. The Short Version</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>What we collect:</strong> Your email, name, and the guitar collection data you choose to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>What we don't do:</strong> Sell your data, track you around the web, or spam you with emails.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Your control:</strong> You can export or delete your data anytime.
    </p>
