    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 2025</p>

    <div class="friendly-note">
        <strong>👋 Hey there!</strong><br>
        These terms are written in plain English because nobody likes reading legal jargon. This is a fun, personal project for tracking guitar collections. We're keeping it simple and friendly.
    </div>

    <h2>1. The Basics</h2>
    <p>
        By using this Guitar Collection app, you agree to these terms. If you don't agree, that's totally fine – just don't use the app. We're not going to track you down or anything.
    </p>

    <h2>2. What This App Is</h2>
    <p>
        This is a personal project to help you track and organize your guitar collection. It's free to use, built for fun, and provided "as-is" without any fancy warranties. Think of it as a digital notebook for your guitars.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Your Account</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You're responsible for keeping your password secure</li>
        <li>Don't share your account with others</li>
        <li>Let us know if someone accesses your account without permission</li>
        <li>You must be 13 years or older to use this app</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Your Content (Your Guitar Data)</h2>
    <p>
        All the guitar information, photos, and notes you add belong to you. We don't claim any ownership of your data. You're free to export it, delete it, or do whatever you want with it.
    </p>
    <p>
        That said, you're responsible for:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Making sure you have the right to upload any photos</li>
        <li>Not uploading anything illegal, harmful, or offensive</li>
        <li>Backing up your own data (seriously, we're just a hobby project!)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. What We Won't Do</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We won't sell your data</li>
        <li>We won't spam you with emails</li>
        <li>We won't share your guitar collection with anyone</li>
        <li>We won't use your photos for marketing or anything else</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. What We Can't Promise</h2>
    <p>
        This is a personal/hobby project, so we need to be honest:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The app might have bugs (we'll try to fix them!)</li>
        <li>The service might go down sometimes</li>
        <li>We can't guarantee your data will be safe forever (please back it up!)</li>
        <li>Features might change or break occasionally</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We're providing this free app without any guarantees. Use it at your own risk, and please keep your own backups of important data.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Things You Shouldn't Do</h2>
    <p>
        Please don't:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Try to hack or break the app</li>
        <li>Upload viruses or malicious code</li>
        <li>Pretend to be someone else</li>
        <li>Use the app for anything illegal</li>
        <li>Try to scrape or steal other users' data</li>
        <li>Abuse the service or overload our servers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Basically, be cool. Don't be a jerk.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Your privacy matters! Check out our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details, but here's the quick version:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We only collect what's necessary (email, guitar data you enter)</li>
        <li>We don't track you around the internet</li>
        <li>We use industry-standard security practices</li>
        <li>You can delete your account and data anytime</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Termination</h2>
    <p>
        You can stop using the app whenever you want – no questions asked. We might also need to suspend or delete accounts that violate these terms or are abusing the service.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
        We might update these terms occasionally. If we make big changes, we'll let you know somehow (probably an email or a notice in the app). Continuing to use the app after changes means you accept the new terms.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Disclaimer & Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>This is important (sorry for the caps, but legally we have to say this):</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        THIS SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS-IS" AND "AS-AVAILABLE" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
    </p>
    <p>
        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE (INCLUDING OUR OWNERS, OPERATORS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, AND ANYONE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SERVICE) SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages</li>
        <li>Loss of data, profits, revenue, or business opportunities</li>
        <li>Personal injury or property damage of any nature whatsoever</li>
        <li>Unauthorized access to or use of our servers or any personal information stored therein</li>
        <li>Any bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like transmitted through the service</li>
        <li>Any errors or omissions in content or for any loss or damage incurred from using content</li>
        <li>Service interruptions, deletions, errors, or defects</li>
        <li>Damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from downloading any content</li>
        <li>Actions or inactions of third parties</li>
        <li>Any claims arising from your use or inability to use this service</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        THIS LIMITATION APPLIES WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
    </p>
    <p>
        IN JURISDICTIONS THAT DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN DAMAGES, OUR LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>In plain English:</strong> We built this for fun and we hope you enjoy it, but we can't be held responsible if something goes wrong, breaks, or causes any kind of problem. You use this service entirely at your own risk. Please keep backups of your important data!
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Maximum Liability:</strong> To the extent permitted by law, if we are found liable for anything, our total liability to you for all claims shall not exceed the amount you paid us for the service (which is currently $0, since it's free).
    </p>

    <h2>12. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>
        You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless (including our owners, operators, employees, affiliates, and anyone associated with this service) from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your use or misuse of the service</li>
        <li>Your violation of these terms</li>
        <li>Your violation of any rights of another person or entity</li>
        <li>Any content you submit, post, or transmit through the service</li>
        <li>Any breach of your representations and warranties</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>In plain English:</strong> If you do something that gets us in legal trouble, you're responsible for dealing with it and covering any costs. Don't upload illegal stuff, don't violate copyright, and basically just be a decent human being.
    </p>

    <h2>13. Contact</h2>
    <p>
        Questions, concerns, or just want to chat about guitars? Feel free to reach out!
    </p>
    <p>
        We're friendly and we actually read messages. 🎸
    </p>

    <h2>14. The Legal Stuff</h2>
    <p>
        These terms are governed by common sense and goodwill, but if we need to get formal, they're subject to the laws where the service is operated. Any disputes will be resolved in a chill, reasonable manner – hopefully over coffee, not in court.
    </p>

    <div class="friendly-note">
        <strong>Bottom Line:</strong><br>
        Be nice, respect others' data, don't break stuff, and have fun tracking your awesome guitar collection. That's really what this is all about! 🎸
